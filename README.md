This project was developed in the context of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course and aims to design and implement a calendar management system using Java, following core OOP principles.

The system allows the creation and management of accounts, events, and guests, supporting different user roles and event types. The architecture was designed to be modular and extensible, relying heavily on interfaces, encapsulation, and separation of concerns.

Key object-oriented concepts applied in this project include:

  Abstraction and Interfaces to define system contracts
  
  Encapsulation to protect internal state and ensure data consistency
  
  Inheritance and Polymorphism to support multiple account and event types
  
  Comparators to manage and sort events
  
  Clean class responsibilities following good design practices

The project focuses on building a robust and maintainable codebase, emphasizing clarity, reusability, and adherence to object-oriented design principles rather than graphical interfaces.
